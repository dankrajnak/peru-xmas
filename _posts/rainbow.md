Marvel at nature and conquer one of the most beautiful peaks in Peru, the famous “Palccoyo” Rainbow Mountain. It’s one of the most impressive hidden gems that Peru has. We will not only see “one” rainbow mountain but three incredible mountains full of colors, and the mysterious rock forest, a famous place well known by the andean shamans. If we get lucky we may even be accompanied by a wandering llama or alpaca during the walk!

**Note this is from Cusco, not Lima, so this will only be possible if we travel there.**
