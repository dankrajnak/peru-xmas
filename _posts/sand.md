After an early morning pickup, we'll head to the city of Paracas, and upon arrival we will go to Puerto del Chaco where we will board a boat to start the excursion to the Ballestas Islands. We will appreciate the great diversity of marine fauna in the area such as sea lions, Humboldt penguins, guano birds among other species and we will also appreciate the Candelabra, the iconic image of the Paracas Reserve. If that wasn't enough, we'll then move to Ica to visit the "El Catador" Winery and the Huacachina Oasis, where we can hope on a buggy or a sandboard and end the day on the dunes.
